<p>My dad worked during so many AT&amp;T eras/permutations that its really hard to keep track. It started as the original Ma Bell AT&amp;T, was split up in a 1984 antitrust case, became Pacific Telesis, then <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Bell'>Pac Bell</a> which was aquired by SBC (formerly Southwestern Bell). SBC eventually acquired the original divested AT&amp;T to become AT&amp;T once again. One of his many offices was 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco, which housed the now infamous <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A'>Room 641A</a>.

      * ### HOW TO CREATE A VALID ID TO USE: ###
      * Go to www.twitter.com and sign in as normal, go to your settings page.
      * Go to "Widgets" on the left hand side.
      * Create a new widget for what you need eg "user timeline" or "search" etc. 
      * Feel free to check "exclude replies" if you dont want replies in results.
      * Now go back to settings page, and then go back to widgets page, you should
      * see the widget you just created. Click edit.
      * Now look at the URL in your web browser, you will see a long number like this:
      * 345735908357048478
      * Use this as your ID below instead!
      */

       * How to use fetch function:
       * @param {string} Your Twitter widget ID.
       * @param {string} The ID of the DOM element you want to write results to. 
       * @param {int} Optional - the maximum number of tweets you want returned. Must
       *     be a number between 1 and 20.
       * @param {boolean} Optional - set true if you want urls and hash
             tags to be hyperlinked!
       * @param {boolean} Optional - Set false if you dont want user photo /
       *     name for tweet to show.
       * @param {boolean} Optional - Set false if you dont want time of tweet
       *     to show.
       * @param {function/string} Optional - A function you can specify to format
       *     tweet date/time however you like. This function takes a JavaScript date
       *     as a parameter and returns a String representation of that date.
       *     Alternatively you may specify the string 'default' to leave it with
       *     Twitter's default renderings.
       * @param {boolean} Optional - Show retweets or not. Set false to not show.
       * @param {function/string} Optional - A function to call when data is ready. It
       *     also passes the data to this function should you wish to manipulate it
       *     yourself before outputting. If you specify this parameter you  must
       *     output data yourself!
